# 📘 Day 04 Notes — Palindrome Checker (String & Number)

This notes file explains the **logic, reasoning, and Java concepts**
used in the Palindrome Checker project.

It is designed for **beginners** to clearly understand the thought process.

---

## 🔍 What is a Palindrome?

A **palindrome** is a value that:

- Reads the same from left to right
- Reads the same from right to left

Examples:

- Numbers → 121, 1331
- Strings → "madam", "level"

## 🔢 Palindrome Logic for Numbers

### Step-by-Step

1. Take the original number
2. Reverse it using a loop
3. Compare reversed number with original

### Why This Works

Reversing digits tests whether the order remains the same.

---

## 🔤 Palindrome Logic for Strings

### Step-by-Step

1. Traverse the string from end to start
2. Build a reversed string
3. Compare with original string

### Key Difference

- Numbers use **math operations**
- Strings use **character manipulation**

---

## 🧠 Logical Skills Improved

This project improves:

- Reverse thinking
- Comparison logic
- Method-based problem solving
- Handling different data types

---

## 🎯 Interview Insight

Palindrome problems are common because they test:

- Loop understanding
- Condition accuracy
- Attention to detail

Clear logic is always preferred over complex solutions.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Used

- Separate methods for number and string checks
- Meaningful variable names
- Beginner-friendly logic
- No unnecessary complexity

---

📌 **Reminder:**  
If you can clearly explain palindrome logic, your fundamentals are strong.
