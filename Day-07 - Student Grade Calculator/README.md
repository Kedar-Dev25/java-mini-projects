## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 07** is to build a **Student Grade Calculator** using arrays to:

- Store multiple subject marks
- Calculate total and average
- Assign grades based on average
- Strengthen array-based thinking

This project moves from single-variable logic to **multi-value data handling**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Concepts

- Arrays
- `for` loop
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- User input using `Scanner`

### Logical Skills

- Storing multiple values
- Calculating average
- Designing grading conditions
- Aggregating data

---

## 📊 What I Built

I built a **Student Grade Calculator** where:

- User enters marks for multiple subjects
- Program calculates:
  - Total Marks
  - Average Marks
- Based on average, a grade is assigned:
  - A Grade
  - B Grade
  - C Grade
  - Fail

📌 Array-based storage  
📌 Real academic grading logic  
📌 Structured and clean output

<h2>⚙️ Program Logic Explained</h2>

Ask user for number of subjects

Create an array to store marks

Use a loop to take marks input

Calculate total using loop

Find average:

Average = Total / Number of Subjects

Assign grade using conditions:

90+ → Grade A  
75–89 → Grade B  
50–74 → Grade C  
Below 50 → Fail

Display total, average, and grade

This demonstrates data aggregation using arrays.

<h2>📝 Notes & Observations</h2>

Arrays allow storing multiple values in one variable

Loops simplify repeated input collection

Average calculation requires proper type handling

Structured grading improves logical thinking

---

<h2>💡 Key Takeaways</h2>

Arrays are essential for handling grouped data

Loop + Array combination is powerful

Conditions define system rules

Clean logic improves readability

---

<h2>🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 07 Level)</h2>

Q1. Why do we use arrays in this project?  
To store multiple subject marks efficiently.

Q2. What happens if we don’t use a loop for input?  
We would need separate variables for each subject.

Q3. Why is average calculated using total/size?  
Because average represents the mean of all values.

Q4. How can this project be improved?  
By adding grade distribution, highest/lowest marks, or percentage formatting.
