## 🎯 Goal of the Day

The goal of **Day 05** is to build a **Simple Interest Calculator** that helps practice:

- Taking numeric input from users
- Applying real-world mathematical formulas
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Displaying structured output

This project connects **mathematics with programming logic**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

### Core Java Concepts

- `Scanner` class
- `double` data type
- Arithmetic operations
- Variable declaration

## 💰 What I Built

I built a **Simple Interest Calculator** where:

- The user enters:
  - Principal amount
  - Rate of interest
  - Time (in years)
- The program calculates:
  - Simple Interest
  - Total Amount

📌 Real-world finance logic  
📌 Beginner-friendly structure  
📌 Clean and readable implementation

<h2>⚙️ Program Logic Explained</h2>

Take principal amount as input

Take rate of interest as input

Take time period as input

Apply the formula:

SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Calculate total amount:

Total = Principal + SI

Display results clearly

This demonstrates practical application of arithmetic operations.

<h2>📝 Notes & Observations</h2>

Mathematical formulas can be directly translated into Java expressions

`double` is important when working with money values

Clear variable naming improves readability

Simple projects build strong programming fundamentals

---

<h2>💡 Key Takeaways</h2>

Programming is problem-solving

Real-world calculations strengthen logic

Clean structure makes code professional

Understanding basics is more important than complexity

---

<h2>🎯 Interview Preparation (Day 05 Level)</h2>

Q1. Why is `double` preferred over `int` in this program?  
Because interest values may contain decimals.

Q2. What will happen if we forget to divide by 100?  
The interest value will be 100 times larger than expected.

Q3. How can this program be improved?  
By adding compound interest calculation or input validation.

Q4. Why is user input important in beginner projects?  
It makes the program interactive and practical.
