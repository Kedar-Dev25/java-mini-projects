## 📌 What I Built Today

1. Factorial using Recursion
2. Fibonacci Series using Recursion

---

## 🧠 Concept Focus — Recursion

Recursion is when a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

It always has:

- Base Case (Stopping condition)
- Recursive Case (Function calling itself)

---

## 🔢 1️⃣ Factorial Using Recursion

Factorial of n (n!) = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1

Example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

### 📂 File: `Factorial.java`

## 🔁 2️⃣ Fibonacci Using Recursion

Fibonacci Series:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ...

Formula:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

### 📂 File: `Fibonacci.java`

## 🚀 Skills Practiced

✔ Understanding recursive calls  
✔ Base condition importance  
✔ Stack behavior awareness  
✔ Breaking problems into smaller parts

---

## ⚠️ Important Learning

Recursion is powerful but:

- Can be slower
- Uses more memory (call stack)
- Needs careful base condition

---

## 🎯 Growth Reflection

Today I moved from basic loops  
to understanding function call stacks.

This is the foundation for:

- Divide & Conquer
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Tree Traversals

---

Consistency continues.
Day 08 Completed.
