# 🧠 Week 01 Reflection — Engineering Growth Log

</div>

---

## 📌 What I Learned

- How to convert problems into structured logic
- Importance of loops in real-world systems
- How arrays simplify grouped data handling
- Why validation matters in simulations
- Writing clean and readable Java programs

---

## ❌ Mistakes I Made

- Initially rushed logic without planning
- Forgot edge cases in some programs
- Did not think about scalability in early projects

---

## 🔍 What Improved

- My thinking became more structured
- I now write cleaner variable names
- I understand flow control better
- I can break down problems step-by-step

---

## 🏗️ Foundation Built

Week 01 focused on:

- Syntax clarity
- Logic control
- Basic system simulation
- Data aggregation using arrays

This is the base layer for OOP and advanced concepts.

---

## 🎯 Week 02 Focus

- Improve problem-solving speed
- Introduce OOP thinking
- Write modular code
- Reduce repetition

---

## 🔥 Self-Evaluation

Consistency Level: 8/10  
Logic Clarity: Improving  
Confidence Level: Growing

This journey is about long-term engineering mindset.
